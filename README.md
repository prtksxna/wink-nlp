Wink NLP is an advance NLP package with zero dependecies outside winkjs. It supports a variety of NLP tasks such as tokenization, sentence boundary detection, negation handling, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction and more with ease.

We deliver developer friendly API along with a balance of performance and accuracy to the entire spectrum of users. In addition, we are working towards building a number of pre-trained models for different languages and domains.
